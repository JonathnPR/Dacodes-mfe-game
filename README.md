# DaCodes Modular Platform

This repository is a monorepo for a modular web platform using **Micro-Frontends (MFEs)** with React, Vite, Module Federation, and a backend built with **NestJS**. It is managed with **pnpm workspaces** for efficient dependency and project management.

## Demo (No WebSockets)

You can try a small demo of the platform (without WebSockets) here:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://dacodesmfe.netlify.app/](https://dacodesmfe.netlify.app/)

> **Note:** This demo version does not include real-time features via WebSockets.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18.x
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 8.x
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running Redis and optionally the backend)

---

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Set up your environment variables:**

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root and adjust the values as needed:

   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Start Docker (Redis):**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Free up ports 6991 and 6990:**

   Make sure ports 6991 and 6990 are not in use. You can kill any processes using them with:

   ```sh
   lsof -ti:6991 | xargs kill -9
   lsof -ti:6990 | xargs kill -9
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Build all packages:**

   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```

6. **Start the backend:**

   ```sh
   cd apis/leaderboard
   pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm start
   ```

7. **In another terminal, from the root, start the frontend:**

   ```sh
   pnpm build && pnpm start
   ```

8. **Open the app:**

   Go to [http://localhost:8700/login](http://localhost:8700/login)

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory and adjust as needed:

```sh
cp env.example .env
```

**Key variables:**

- Service ports (frontend and backend)
- Module federation entrypoints
- API endpoints
- Redis configuration

Example:

```env
VITE_APP_GATEWAY_PORT=8700
VITE_SERVICE_A_ENTRY=http://localhost:8700/assets/root.js
VITE_API_RANK_URL=http://localhost:6991
VITE_CACHE_HOSTNAME=localhost
VITE_CACHE_PORT=6379
```

---

## Install Dependencies

Install all dependencies for every workspace (MFEs, backend, shared lib):

```sh
pnpm install
```

---

## Development

You can run all MFEs and backend in parallel, or individually.

### Run All in Parallel

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This will start all MFEs and backend services in development mode.

### Run Individual Apps

Each MFE and backend can be started individually. For example:

```sh
pnpm --filter @dacodes/auth-mfe dev
pnpm --filter @dacodes/directory-mfe dev
pnpm --filter @dacodes/memory-game-mfe dev
pnpm --filter @dacodes/profile-mfe dev
pnpm --filter @dacodes/shell dev
```

For the backend, **make sure to start Docker first** (for Redis):

```sh
# Start Redis (required for backend)
docker-compose up -d

# Then start the backend service
cd apis/leaderboard
pnpm start
```

---

## Build for Production

Build all apps and packages:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Or build a specific app:

```sh
pnpm --filter @dacodes/auth-mfe build
```

---

## Run with Docker

This project includes a `docker-compose.yml` for running infrastructure services (e.g., Redis):

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a Redis instance on port 6379. You can connect your backend and MFEs to this Redis instance using the environment variables.

> **Note:** The current Docker Compose only includes Redis. To dockerize the backend/frontend, you can add more services to `docker-compose.yml` as needed.

---

## Shared Library

The `packages/lib` directory contains shared TypeScript code (domain models, DTOs, repositories) used by both frontend and backend. Import from `@dacodes/lib` in your apps.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all ports in `.env` match those used in your MFEs and backend.
- If you see errors about missing environment variables, check your `.env` file and Vite/NestJS configs.
- For module federation issues, verify entrypoints and output filenames.
- If you get React version mismatches, ensure all MFEs use the same React version.
